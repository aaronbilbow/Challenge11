# Mars Data Scraping and Analysis


## Overview

This repository contains Python code for scraping data from Mars-related websites and analyzing the collected data. It is divided into two parts:

1. **Part 1: Mars News Scraping**
   - Automates web browsing to visit the Mars News website.
   - Scrapes and extracts the titles and preview text of news articles related to Mars.
   - Stores the data in Python dictionaries and optionally exports it to a JSON file.

2. **Part 2: Mars Weather Data Scraping and Analysis**
   - Uses web scraping techniques to collect temperature and atmospheric pressure data from a Mars temperature data website.
   - Assembles the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Analyzes the dataset to answer various questions about Mars weather.

## Prerequisites
